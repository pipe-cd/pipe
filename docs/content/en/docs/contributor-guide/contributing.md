PipeCD is an open source project that anyone in the community can use, improve, and enjoy. We'd love you to join us! 

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") described at [pipe-cd/pipe/master/CLA.md](https://github.com/pipe-cd/pipe/blob/master/CLA.md). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project.

You generally only need to sign a CLA once, so if you've already signed one, you probably don't need to do it again.

In case you have not signed yet, [CLA plugin](docs/plugins/cla) will guide you to sign the CLA _when you send the first pull request to [PipeCD](https://github.com/pipe-cd/pipe) repository_.

## Creating an issue

If you've found a problem, please create an issue in the [PipeCD repository](https://github.com/pipe-cd/pipe/issues).

## Creating a pull request

Look at our [help wanted issues](https://github.com/pipe-cd/pipe/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%2Fhelp-wanted) for finding some good issues for your first pull request.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for more information on using pull requests.
