**Visibility**
- Deployment pipeline UI shows clarify what is happening
- Separate logs viewer for each individual deployment
- Realtime visualization of application state
- Deployment notifications to slack, webhook endpoints
- Insights show metrics like lead time, deployment frequency, MTTR and change failure rate to measure delivery performance

**Automation**
- Automated deployment analysis to measure deployment impact based on metrics, logs, emitted requests
- Automatically roll back to the previous state as soon as analysis or a pipeline stage fails
- Automatically detect configuration drift to notify and render the changes

**Safety and Security**
- Support single sign-on and role-based access control
- Credentials are not exposed outside the cluster and not saved in the control-plane
- Piped makes only outbound requests and can run inside a restricted network
- Built-in secrets management

**Multi-provider & Multi-Tenancy**
- Support multiple application kinds on multi-cloud including Kubernetes, Terraform, Cloud Run, AWS Lambda
- Support multiple analysis providers including Prometheus, Datadog, Stackdriver, and more
- Easy to operate multi-cluster, multi-tenancy by separating control-plane and piped
